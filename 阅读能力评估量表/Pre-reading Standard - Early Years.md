# Pre-reading Standard: Early Years

The Pre-reading Standard supports the observation and recording of early reading behaviours, listening and oral language skills. It is designed to help teachers evaluate children’s pre-school experiences so that they can best meet the needs of the whole class.

Children whose experience of reading and language is good prior to starting school will readily demonstrate many of these behaviours and you will be able to teach, observe and assess these children against Standard 1 fairly quickly. Other children will need more exposure to books and language before they are ready for the more formal teaching of reading to begin.

Children at the Pre-reading Standard will be able to explore, talk about and identify letter sounds in words in books at `Oxford Levels 1` and `1+`.
